# In this code, I'm analyzing Netflix's database to answer questions about the data.

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
#Filtering by movies, use to countget the number of titles.
SELECT COUNT(title) AS title_count 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
# Used max to extract the most recent date.
SELECT MAX(DATE(date_added)) AS recently_added_date
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
#Join the "netflix_titles_info" to "netflix_people", filter by title and extract the director. 
SELECT people.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
  ON people.show_id=titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title='Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
#Filter by movies, group data by title and release year. Select title and use MIN to select oldest year, order by year and limit results to 1.
SELECT title, MIN(release_year) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
GROUP BY title, release_year
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;
