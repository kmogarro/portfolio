#In this project, I'm using Spotify's 2021 Top 50 song data to gain insight into songs and musicians featured

#I started by creating a table that corresponded to the data in the file
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotify_Top50_2021(
    id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
    track_name varchar NOT NULL,
    track_id varchar NOT NULL,
    popularity integer NOT NULL,
    danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
    energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
    key integer NOT NULL,
    loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
    mode integer NOT NULL,
    speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
    acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
    instrumentalness text NOT NULL,

    valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
    tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
    duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
    time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then after inserting the data (.csv) into the table, I used SQL to explore the data a bit

#First I determined the most popular song with the least amount of valence, which Spotify defines as the least amount of positiveness conveyed by a track.
SELECT
    artist_name
    ,track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotify_Top50_2021
ORDER BY popularity desc, valence

#Then, I wanted to know the top 5 songs with highest valence or highest "positiveness" levels
SELECT 
    artist_name
    ,track_name 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotify_Top50_2021
ORDER BY valence desc
LIMIT 5;

#Then the average length of the songs in the Top 50
SELECT
    AVG(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotify_Top50_2021

#Lastly, I wanted to see the artists that appear more than once in Top 50
