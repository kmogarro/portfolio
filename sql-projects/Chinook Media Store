#In this project I'm utilizing the dataset "chinook", a digital media store, to answer questions about items, customers and employees

WHERE country <> 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT 
    cust.firstname
    ,cust.lastname

where title = 'Sales Support Agent'

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

JOIN chinook.employees emp ON emp.employeeid=cust.supportrepid

#8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "2009 Invoices" FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009-%';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(total), 2) AS "2009 Total Sales" FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009-%';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item.
SELECT
    name AS track
    ,invoicelineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks ON tracks.TrackId=inv.trackid

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line item.

ORDER BY album;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

JOIN employees ON employees.EmployeeId=customers.SupportRepId
GROUP BY name

#14. Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2009?
